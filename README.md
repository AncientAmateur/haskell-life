# Conway's Game of Life in Haskell

## Rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (referred to as underpopulation).
2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (referred to as overpopulation or overcrowding).
3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours will come to life.
